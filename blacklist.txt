Junk food -- not to mention too * little * nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse .
If you think an exception is deserved message the mods .
Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky .

Share what sucks this week , this minute , this hour … MS related or not , this is the place to let it out !
EMDR , HBCT , SEPt , SP4T and NARM are first - rate for memory - reprocessing , sense - making and detachment from the conditioning , programming , etc .
@ cyclingsets : You don ' t miss anything .
There is a chat for this sub :-)
Feeling like you need someone to talk to a little more than in a post ?
Feel free to share anything , we ' re here !
RemindMe !
( You ' re welcome to look over my posts elsewhere on reddit to assure yourself that I ' m not repping for some guru or psych hospital , of course .)
Thanks again :)
The CBTs deconstruct one ' s inaccurate beliefs , values , ideals , principles , convictions , rules , codes , regulations and requirements about how we or they ( or the world ) should / must / ought / Personal blogs are not permitted .
Then interview * them * as though they were applying for a job with * your * company .
DBT , MBCT , ACT , MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management .
It also helps prevent mods from profiling and censoring .

Hey CommonMisspellingBot , just a quick heads up : Your spelling hints are really shitty because they ' re all essentially " remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word ".
Your post was removed as spam , please message the Mods to verify you are human and your post will be approved , no need to worry or delete :) I am a bot , and this action was performed automatically .
This group meets every Sunday and Wednesday , but you can post at any time .
Feel free to upvote for visibility but please do not downvote in this place - there is plenty of other reddit for that !
High - quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind , but HQ * fresh * ( especially Mediterranean -- though not * pizza -- and Asian ) food appears to be best for pts with C - PTSD symptoms .
Healthy fats in moderation , btw , are known to be good for depression .
